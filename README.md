### About
This is a collection of my solutions of competitive programming problems located at [cses.fi](https://cses.fi).
The intro section will be of varying quality due to:
    1. Moving from Python -> C++ (new to this).
    2. Setting up my CP environment incrementally to get used to it. 

The further sections should have consistent environments...hopefully.
